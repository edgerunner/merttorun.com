= Multi Site

Created by Sean Cribbs, November 2007. Inspired by the original virtual_domain
behavior.

Multi Site allows you to host multiple websites on a single Radiant
installation.

Each site has its own independent sitemap/page-tree and these attributes:

  name: Whatever you want to call the site
  domain: A Ruby regular expression (without the //) to match the request
          against
  base_domain: A canonical domain name for doing quicker matches and for
               generating absolute URLs against
  homepage_id: The numerical database ID of the root page (usually
               you can just leave this alone).

Included images are slightly modified from FamFamFam Silk Icons by Mark James:

1) Unpack/checkout/export the extension into vendor/extensions of your 
   project.

== Other Extensions

Multi Site allows you to customize routes within your other extensions. To
restrict a route to a particular site, pass the site's name into the
conditions hash:

   map.resources :things, :conditions => { :site => 'My Site' }

You can also scope a route to multiple sites with an array:

   map.resources :things, :conditions => { :site => ['My Site', 'Your Site'] }
