ImageSpec
=========

ImageSpec is a lightweight module designed to extract width/height dimensions from most standard image formats, as well as SWFs.

This is a work in progress.  I intend on expanding this to include other details (EXIF, various metadata, etc.) as well.


Example
=======

# From a file in your file system
instance = ImageSpec.new('/path/to/your/file')

# From a URL
instance = ImageSpec.new('http://example.com/image.png')

# From an IO stream
file = File.new('/path/to/your/file', 'rb')
instance = ImageSpec.new(file)

instance.width
instance.height
instance.content_type

Pretty simple, huh?
